Question 1 : Why you should not commit credentials on git?

From a security and maintainability perspective, itâ€™s best not to put the configuration and security elements on git.

Question 2 : Why may you want different configurations depending on the environment? Give an example.

Confugartion changes depending on the environment in which our application runs, which is why it is better to presonalize it for everyone. For example, for a local development, if you connect to a local database, the login, login password and port may change.
