# advanced-web-M1
This is a repository for TP1 in a advanced web in M1 at EFREI available at https://github.com/SimonMartinenq/advanced-web-M1.git

This TP1 have been realised by : Astryd CASIMIR and Simon MARTINENQ

To look our TP by using the http-server, 
you can use the commande line : npx http-server -a 127.0.0.1.
Then you can clink on the link, go on your browser, inspect the page
and go into the console to see the js results.

For testing our functions by using the specs, 
you need toggle line //import fetch from "node-fetch" in ex4-ex5.js
and you can use the commmand line : npx mocha --timeout=8000 specs/ex4-ex5.spec.js
If you want to test all the specs you just need to change the name of the file
Example for the ex1 : npx mocha --timeout=8000 specs/ex1.spec.js

Good reading
Hoping that you will like our tp
